This means that, although it will be written like \\(\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^\\top\\), you should apply the transpose in your head: \\[\n\\mathbf{v} = (v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n)^\\top = \\begin{bmatrix}v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\]\n\nMatrix: An \\(m \\times n\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{M}_{[m \\times n]}\\) is an \\(m\\)-by-\\(n\\) grid of scalars, where the scalar in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column is denoted \\(m_{i,j}\\). In the class, we will be careful to add a subscript like \\(\\mathbf{M}_{[m \\times n]}\\) to indicate the number of rows (\\(m\\)) and columns (\\(n\\)) in the matrix, since operations like multiplication are only defined for matrices with particular dimensions.\nMatrix multiplication: For two matrices \\(\\mathbf{X}_{[a \\times b]}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{[c \\times d]}\\), matrix multiplication is defined if \\(b = c\\), and produces the following \\(a \\times d\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{XY}_{[a \\times d]}\\):\n\\[\n  \\mathbf{XY}_{[a \\times d]} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  x_{1,1}y_{1,1} & \\cdots & x_{m,1}y_{1,n} \\\\\n  \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n  x_{1,n}y_{m,1} & \\cdots & x_{m,n}y_{m,n}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\]\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^n f(i)\\): \\(\\Sigma\\) is the capitalized Greek letter “Sigma”, and stands for “Sum” in this case. This notation means: “the sum of \\(f(i)\\) from \\(i = 1\\) to \\(i = n\\)”. For example, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^3 i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 14\\).\n\\(\\prod_{i=1}^n f(i)\\): \\(\\Pi\\) is the capitalized Greek letter “Pi”, and stands for “Product” in this case. This notation means: “the product of \\(f(i)\\) from \\(i = 1\\) to \\(i = n\\)”. For example, \\(\\prod_{i=1}^3 i^2 = 1^2 \\cdot 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 = 36\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\\([a,b] \\in \\mathbb{R}\\): The closed interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) containing all numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), including \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.\n\\((a,b) \\in \\mathbb{R}\\): The open interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). That is, the subset of \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) containing all numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), excluding \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) themselves.\n\\([a, b)\\), \\((a, b]\\): The half-open interval between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In the first case, we include \\(a\\) but exclude \\(b\\), while in the second we exclude \\(a\\) but include \\(b\\).\n\\(\\int_{a}^b f(x)dx\\): The integral of the function \\(f(x)\\) between points \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In this course, you just need to remember that this produces the area under the curve of \\(f(x)\\) between these points.\n\\(\\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ f(x) \\right]\\): The derivative of the function \\(f(x)\\). For this class, you just need to remember that the derivative is what transforms a Cumulative Density Function (CDF) into a Probability Density Function (PDF): if \\(F_X(v)\\) is the CDF of a random variable \\(X\\), then \\(\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ F_X(v) \\right] = f_X(v)\\), the PDF of \\(X\\).\n\nFor functions of multiple variables, like the joint pdf \\(f_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\), we use the \\(\\partial\\) symbol instead of \\(d\\) to denote partial derivatives: for example, the change in \\(F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\) as \\(v_X\\) changes is denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_X}\\left[ F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y) \\right]\\), while the change in \\(F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y)\\) as \\(v_Y\\) changes is denoted \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_Y}\\left[ F_{X,Y}(v_X, v_Y) \\right]\\).",

Concretely, to see what’s going on, let’s just look at the row filter we’ve provided (the portion of the full code that is within the square brackets [], before the comma):\n\nsample(nrow(deck_df), 15, replace = TRUE)\n\n [1] 37 42 28 29 45 16 20 41 34 25 44 37 35 29 48\n\n\nWe see that, in fact, we are not really sampling from the data.frame itself, so much as sampling from a list of its indices (from 1 to 52), and then after performing this sample we are going and asking R to give us the rows at the indices that ended up in this sample. Keeping this distinction in mind (between the rows themselves and their indices) can be helpful for debugging code like this."

    "section": "Step 0: What Do I Mean By “Simulating” a Sample Space?",
    "text": "Step 0: What Do I Mean By “Simulating” a Sample Space?\nWhat I’m referring to here is, for example, the information you are given at the top of Quiz 1, stating that a random sample contained:\n\n340 people currently using an iPhone,\n185 people using a different phone who don’t want to switch phones ever, and\n232 people using a different phone but hoping to switch to an iPhone in the future.\n\nThe idea is that we can generate a tibble which “encodes” this information in its rows, by allowing us to use the naïve definition of probability to compute probabilities of particular types of people: for example, say we are interested in the probability that a person in our sample uses an iPhone. Mathematically (by the naïve definition), if we construct a random variable \\(F\\) (for iFone, of course) representing the outcome of a randomly-selected person’s phone type (so that \\(F = 1\\) if the person we ask ends up being an iPhone user, and \\(F = 0\\) otherwise), then we can use the information from our sample to compute \\(\\Pr(F = 1)\\) as\n\\[\n\\Pr(F = 1) = \\frac{\\#\\text{ iPhone users in sample}}{\\#\\text{ People in sample}}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThis means, therefore, that if we had a tibble called df where each row contained information on one particular person from our sample, then we could “translate” this naive definition formula into code as something like\nprob_F &lt;- nrow(df[df$iphone == 1,]) / nrow(df)\nSince here df[df$iphone == 1,] would subset the full df to keep only those rows corresponding to people with iPhones, while df itself (without any filters applied) would contain a row for each person. Literally, we are applying the following “translation” of the naïve definition-based formula (Equation 1) into code:\n\\[\n\\Pr(F = 1) = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\#}^{\\texttt{nrow}}\\overbrace{\\text{ iPhone users in sample}}^{\\texttt{df[df\\$iphone == 1]}}}{\\underbrace{\\#}_{\\texttt{nrow}}\\underbrace{\\text{ People in sample}}_{\\texttt{df}}}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nSimilarly, say we wanted to compute a conditional probability on the basis of our sample, like the probability of a person liking the feature (the feature mentioned in the quiz) given that they are an iPhone user. In this case, let \\(L\\) be an RV such that \\(L = 1\\) if the person likes the feature and \\(L = 0\\) otherwise. Then we can represent the probability we want in this case mathematically using the definition of conditional probability:\n\\[\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid F = 1) = \\frac{\\Pr(L = 1 \\cap F = 1)}{\\Pr(F = 1)}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nAnd then we can interpret this ratio (of \\(\\Pr(L = 1 \\cap F = 1)\\) to \\(\\Pr(F = 1)\\) using the naïve definition of probability to derive a new “naïve definition-based equation for the same conditional probability” written mathematically in Equation 3:\n\\[\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid F = 1) = \\frac{\\#\\text{ iPhone users in sample who like feature}}{\\#\\text{ iPhone users in sample}}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nIn this case, since both the numerator and denominator are restricted to only those people in our sample who are iPhone users, we can make our lives easy by creating a new “only iPhone users” tibble, using code like\niphone_df &lt;- df[df$iphone == 1,]\nAnd, with this iPhone-users-only tibble now available to us, Equation 4 can be translated into code similarly to how we translated Equation 1 into code, as\nprob_L_given_F &lt;- nrow(iphone_df[iphone_df$like_feature == 1]) / nrow(iphone_df)\nWhere once again we have just applied the following set of “translations” to the naïve definition (this time the “conditional naïve definition”):\n\\[\n\\Pr(L = 1 \\mid F = 1) = \\frac{\\overbrace{\\#}^{\\texttt{nrow}}\\overbrace{\\text{ iPhone users in sample who like feature}}^{\\texttt{iphone\\_df[iphone\\_df\\$likes\\_feature == 1]}}}{\\underbrace{\\#}_{\\texttt{nrow}}\\underbrace{\\text{ iPhone users in sample}}_{\\texttt{iphone\\_df}}}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nSo, all of the above shows you how to work with a sample-space-simulating tibble, once you have created it. The following steps will show you how to create such a sample-space-simulating tibble using functions from the tidyverse."

For example, we can define a function called duplicate_row which takes an argument tr representing a tibble_row object and another argument num_reps specifying how many times that tibble_row should be repeated:\n\nduplicate_row &lt;- function(tr, num_reps) {\n    return(tr |&gt; slice(rep(1:n(), num_reps)))\n}\n\nAnd now rather than writing the whole operation over and over again, we can just call duplicate_row as often as needed. If you wanted a tibble which contained the numbers 1 through 5 repeated that many times, for example (that is, the number 1 repeated 1 time, the number 2 repeated 2 times, and so on), this could be done in a loop using our duplicate_row function as follows:\n\n# Create a single row containing the number 1\nfull_tibble &lt;- tibble_row(n = 1)\n# Create 2 rows containing the number 2 and add\n# those 2 rows to full_tibble, then create 3 rows\n# containing the number 3 and add those 3 rows\n# to full_tibble, and so on\nfor (i in 2:5) {\n    row_containing_i &lt;- tibble_row(n = i)\n    repeated_rows &lt;- duplicate_row(row_containing_i, i)\n    full_tibble &lt;- bind_rows(full_tibble, repeated_rows)\n}\ndim(full_tibble)\n\n[1] 15  1\n\nfull_tibble\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n1\n\n\n2\n\n\n2\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n3\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n4\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope that helps a bit, in case this scenario ever comes up again on a homework or quiz, or it comes up on your project or at some point in your future data science career!"

    "text": "Finding The Issue By Thinking Geometrically\nThere are a lot of ways we could stop and try to diagnose what’s going on here, but the approach that helped me most in thinking through this problem was to plot out the space over which we’re integrating the joint pdf, geometrically:\nHere I create what is sometimes called a “mesh grid”, by running the expand_grid() function (from tidyverse, which replaces the base-R expand.grid() function you have already seen, but isn’t very different) to create a grid of points, where these points’ \\(x\\) values are drawn from x and their \\(y\\) values are drawn from y:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nx &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 2, by = 0.01)\ny &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 3, by = 0.01)\nxy_df &lt;- expand_grid(x, y)\n# Display the first and last 6 rows\nxy_df |&gt; head(); xy_df |&gt; tail()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.00\n\n\n0\n0.01\n\n\n0\n0.02\n\n\n0\n0.03\n\n\n0\n0.04\n\n\n0\n0.05\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n2\n2.95\n\n\n2\n2.96\n\n\n2\n2.97\n\n\n2\n2.98\n\n\n2\n2.99\n\n\n2\n3.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext I use the mutate() function to create a new variable, x_leq_y, on the basis of this grid, and look at the count of the number of points in my grid which do and do not satisfy the boolean expression x &lt;= y:\n\n\nCode\nxy_df &lt;- xy_df |&gt; mutate(\n  x_leq_y = as.numeric(x &lt;= y)\n)\nxy_df |&gt; group_by(x_leq_y) |&gt; count(.drop=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx_leq_y\nn\n\n\n\n\n0\n20100\n\n\n1\n40401\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I use ggplot with the geom_tile() geometry to create a simple but helpful visualization of the subset of \\([0,2] \\times [0,3]\\) within which the boolean condition is true (and where I have explicitly drawn lines showing the boundaries within which the point \\((x,y)\\) has a non-zero probability density, as well as the function \\(f(x) = x\\), which will both come in handy later):\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(latex2exp)\nggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x) x) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    fill = TeX(\"$X \\\\leq Y$\"),\n    title = \"The Integration Space, in 2D\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_discrete(labels=c(\"False\",\"True\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now let’s use this plot to think about what we’re doing in both Approach 1 and Approach 2.\n\nApproach 1\nTo think through the double integral in this case, visually, I like to imagine “sweeping” over the space across one dimension when computing the inner integral, then “sweeping” over the space across the other dimension when computing the outer integral.\nRemember that the double integral in Approach 1 was set up as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) &= \\int_{0}^{2}\\int_{x}^{3}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dy~dx\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSo, in this case, we can add some arrows to our plot to show the “sweeping” which is occurring when we compute the inner integral. Since the inner integral is from \\(y = x\\) to \\(y = 3\\), I think of arrows sweeping upwards from the line \\(y = x\\) to the (horizontal) line \\(y = 3\\).\nSo, to make the diagram on the left side of the figure below, which represents the inner integral, I use:\n\nDashed yellow lines to represent the bounds between which we’re “sweeping”, and\nDashed arrows to represent the direction of the sweeping\n\nThen to make the diagram on the right, which represents the outer integral, I use:\n\nSolid yellow lines to represent the bounds between which we’re sweeping, and\nSolid arrows to represent the direction of the sweeping\n\nWhich means that ultimately, after computing the two integrals, we have integrated over the region of the \\(xy\\)-plane bounded by the dashed and solid yellow lines.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(latex2exp)\n# blw = Boundary line width\nblw &lt;- 1\n# blc = Boundary line color\nblc &lt;- 'yellow'\na1_inner_xvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95)\na1_inner_df &lt;- tibble(x=a1_inner_xvals)\na1_inner_df &lt;- a1_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n    xend = x,\n    y = x,\n    yend = 3\n)\na1_inner_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x) x) +\n  geom_segment(data=a1_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=2, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A1.1: Inner Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\n\na1_outer_yvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.95)\na1_outer_df &lt;- tibble(y=a1_outer_yvals)\na1_outer_df &lt;- a1_outer_df |&gt; mutate(\n    yend = y,\n    x = 0,\n    xend = 2\n)\n\na1_outer_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a1_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a1_outer_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun = function(x) x) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=2, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Outer integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  # Outer integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A1.2: Outer Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\na1_inner_plot + a1_outer_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote how, since the inner integral in this case already excluded all points lying beneath the line \\(y = x\\) (the dashed yellow diagonal line), it actually didn’t matter that our outer integral went over this “boundary line”: the overall result of the double-integration only sums up the values of the pdf in the range bounded by the yellow lines. In other words, even though the outer integral does “sweep” over the dashed yellow diagonal \\(y = x\\) line, thus sweeping outside of the range of valid values of \\(x\\), it did not have any density here to sum up, since all of the probability density in this red triangle had been left out of the inner integral.\n(If that last paragraph didn’t make sense to you, don’t worry about it! Just stick to the pictures for intuition)\n\n\nApproach 2\nOn the other hand, recall that the double integral in Approach 2 was set up as follows:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) &= \\int_{0}^{3}\\int_{0}^{y}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nGiven this double integral setup, we can employ this same way of thinking about integration (as “sweeping” across a dimension) to obtain the following diagram, which helps illustrate why we obtain a value greater than 1 in this case:\n\n\nCode\na2_inner_yvals &lt;- c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2.95)\na2_inner_df &lt;- tibble(y=a2_inner_yvals)\na2_inner_df &lt;- a2_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n    yend = y,\n    x = 0.05,\n    xend = y\n)\nribbon_xvals &lt;- seq(from = 2, to = 3, by = 0.01)\nribbon_df &lt;- tibble(x=ribbon_xvals, y=ribbon_xvals)\na2_inner_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=ribbon_df, aes(x=x, ymin=y, ymax=3), alpha=0.333) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=3, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A2.1: Inner Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\n\na2_outer_xvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95, 2.5, 2.95)\na2_outer_df &lt;- tibble(x=a2_outer_xvals)\na2_outer_df &lt;- a2_outer_df |&gt; mutate(\n    xend = x,\n    y = 0,\n    yend = 2.95\n)\n\na2_outer_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a2_outer_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_ribbon(data=ribbon_df, aes(x=x, ymin=y, ymax=3), alpha=0.333) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  # Inner integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Inner integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=3, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Outer integral, lower bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=3, yend=0, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  # Outer integral, upper bound\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=3, yend=3, color=blc, linewidth=blw, linetype='solid') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A2.2: Outer Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\na2_inner_plot + a2_outer_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we see that, whereas in Approach 1 everything worked out since the line \\(y = x\\) was suitable as a mathematical representation of the entire lower bound of \\(y\\), here in Approach 2 we cannot use the line \\(y = x\\) on its own to characterize the upper bound on \\(x\\), since this will include the grey triangle in the diagram above as part of the region over which we’re integrating the joint pdf."

To accomplish this, we can observe that our Approach 2 integral would have worked and would have integrated only over the support of \\((X,Y)\\) if we had broken it up as follows:\n\\[\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) = \\int_{0}^{2}\\int_{0}^{y}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy + \\int_{2}^{3}\\int_{0}^{2}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy\n\\]\nThus we’ll call this way of integrating Approach 3, which can be visualized as follows:\n\n\nCode\na31_inner_yvals &lt;- c(0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95)\na31_inner_df &lt;- tibble(y=a31_inner_yvals)\na31_inner_df &lt;- a31_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n    yend = y,\n    x = 0.05,\n    xend = y\n)\na31_outer_xvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95)\na31_outer_df &lt;- tibble(x=a31_outer_xvals)\na31_outer_df &lt;- a31_outer_df |&gt; mutate(\n    xend = x,\n    y = 0.05,\n    yend = 2\n)\na31_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a31_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a31_outer_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  # Lower bound, inner integral\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=2, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Upper bound, inner integral\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=2, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='dashed') +\n  # Lower bound, outer integral\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='solid') +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=2, xend=2, yend=2, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='solid') +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A3.1: First Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\n\na32_inner_yvals &lt;- c(2.05, 2.5, 2.95)\na32_inner_df &lt;- tibble(y=a32_inner_yvals)\na32_inner_df &lt;- a32_inner_df |&gt; mutate(\n    yend = y,\n    x = 0,\n    xend = 1.95\n)\na32_outer_xvals &lt;- c(0.05, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.95)\na32_outer_df &lt;- tibble(x=a32_outer_xvals)\na32_outer_df &lt;- a32_outer_df |&gt; mutate(\n    xend = x,\n    y = 2,\n    yend = 2.95\n)\n\na32_plot &lt;- ggplot(xy_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_tile(aes(fill=factor(x_leq_y))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a32_inner_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='dashed', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(data=a32_outer_df, aes(x=x, y=y, xend=xend, yend=yend), linetype='solid', arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, \"cm\"))) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=0, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=0, xend=2, yend=0) +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=0, xend=2, yend=3) +\n  # Lower bound of inner integral\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=2, xend=0, yend=3, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='dashed') +\n  geom_segment(x=2, y=2, xend=2, yend=3, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='dashed') +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=3, xend=2, yend=3, color=\"yellow\", linewidth=1, linetype='solid') +\n  geom_segment(x=0, y=2, xend=2, yend=2, color='yellow', linewidth=1, linetype='solid') +\n  stat_function(fun=function(x) x) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"A3.2: Second Integral\"\n  ) +\n  remove_legend()\na31_plot + a32_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we see that the following steps give us the correct result:\n\nWe first integrate the joint pdf over the region displayed on the left: the triangle with vertices at \\((0,0)\\), \\((0,2)\\), and \\((2,2)\\))\nWe then integrate the joint pdf separately over the region displayed on the right: the square with vertices at \\((0,2)\\), \\((0,3)\\), \\((2,2)\\), and \\((2,3)\\)\nAnd then we obtain the total density of the pdf within the admissible (green) region by adding these two results together\n\nMathematically, this gives us (skipping many steps like we did before):\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(X \\leq Y) &= \\int_{0}^{2}\\int_{0}^{y}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy + \\int_{2}^{3}\\int_{0}^{2}f_{X,Y}(x,y)~dx~dy \\\\\n&= \\frac{29}{165} + \\frac{7}{11} = \\frac{134}{165} \\approx 0.812,\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nmatching the result from our original integral, performed in the opposite order.\nHopefully this way of breaking down the relationship between integration and probability can help you out: if you find yourself staring at a problem for too long, try breaking your brain out of the rut by seeing if diagrams like the above can help you reason through what the bounds of your integrals should be 😎"

    "text": "Necessary vs. Sufficient Conditions\nBefore we start, in case the distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions isn’t something you’ve learned before:\n\nIf [a predicate] \\(p\\) is necessary for [a predicate] \\(q\\), then if we know \\(p\\) is false then \\(q\\) must be false.\n\nFor example, let \\(p = [x &gt; 3]\\) and \\(q = [x &gt; 5]\\).\nThen \\(p\\) is a necessary condition for \\(q\\), because in this case if we know that \\(p\\) is false \\(q\\) must also be false.\nNote that the converse does not hold! That is, knowing that \\(p\\) is true does not tell us that \\(q\\) is true: if we know \\(p\\) (so we know that \\(x &gt; 3\\)), we still don’t know \\(q\\), since we could have e.g. \\(x = 4\\).\n\nIf \\(p\\) is sufficient for \\(q\\), then if we know \\(p\\) is true we also know that \\(q\\) is true.\n\nFor example, let \\(p = [x\\text{ is divisible by }4]\\) and \\(q = [x\\text{ is even}]\\)\nThen \\(p\\) is a sufficient condition for \\(q\\), since all numbers divisible by 4 are also even.\nAgain you have to be careful, because the converse does not hold: knowing that \\(q\\) is false in this example does not tell us that \\(p\\) is false: if we know \\(\\neg q\\), we know \\(x\\) is not divisible by 4, but \\(p\\) can still be true, since e.g. \\(x\\) could be 6 (an even number not divisible by 4).\n\n\nI think keeping this in mind is helpful for this specific problem, because we can think about the following two necessary conditions that must hold for a given function \\(f_Z(v)\\) to represent a valid pdf for the random variable \\(Z\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing from Single-Valued to Multi-Valued pdfs\n\n\n\nI use \\(Z\\) to define the pdf \\(f_Z(v)\\) here to emphasize how pdfs are (at their core) defined for single random variables like \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), or \\(Z\\).\nNonetheless, as we enter into multivariable probability world we can consider \\(f_Z(v)\\) as the pdf for a vector-valued random variable \\(Z\\), so that \\(Z\\) can in fact represent a point that is decomposable into an \\(x\\)-coordinate (represented by a random variable \\(X\\)) and a \\(y\\)-coordinate (represented by a random variable \\(Y\\)). In this case, we can rewrite \\(Z\\) as \\((X,Y)\\) and call our pdf \\(f_{(X,Y)}(v_X, x_Y)\\), which for succinctness we usually shorten to just \\(f_{X,Y}(x,y)\\)."

    "text": "Why Are You Telling Us All This? How Does It Help Solve Problem 1?\nIf you’ve made it all the way to this point, you may be frustrated that I still haven’t pointed exactly to how these two conditions help us solve Problem 1.\nSince I can’t give away the solution for that particular problem, here I will show the applicability of these two conditions to a similar problem, and then your job is to think about how the way I work through this problem can help you work through problem 1.\nThe example problem: Given two random variables \\(X \\sim \\mathcal{U}[0,1]\\) and \\(Y \\sim \\mathcal{U}[0,1]\\), consider the joint distribution of the vector-valued random variable \\(Z = (X,Y)\\), where the possible realizations of \\(Z\\) are restricted to only those values of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) such that they lie within a circle of radius \\(1\\) around the origin: that is, \\(X^2 + Y^2 &lt; 1\\). This means that we could create a plot which “fills in” the possible values of \\(Z\\) more and more as we sample more points, by generating values of \\(X\\) sampled from from \\(\\mathcal{U}[0,1]\\) and values of \\(Y\\) sampled from \\(\\mathcal{U}[0,1]\\), then placing the points on the plot if they are “admissible” (if they form a valid realization of \\(Z\\)) and throwing the points away otherwise:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nN &lt;- 2500\nx_vals &lt;- runif(N, -1, 1)\ny_vals &lt;- runif(N, -1, 1)\nsample_df &lt;- tibble(x=x_vals, y=y_vals)\nsample_df &lt;- sample_df |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    admissible = x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1\n  )\nsample_df |&gt; head()\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny\nadmissible\n\n\n\n\n0.0853844\n0.4159406\nTRUE\n\n\n-0.4991692\n-0.6671818\nTRUE\n\n\n-0.5449181\n0.9697597\nFALSE\n\n\n-0.2142207\n-0.8855359\nTRUE\n\n\n0.8015973\n0.2324585\nTRUE\n\n\n-0.6283825\n-0.0055527\nTRUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that, given how admissible is defined, plotting only the points for which admissible == TRUE will mean that we are “filling out” the subset of all possible values in the square \\([-1,1] \\times [-1,1]\\) that satisfy our contstraint:\n\nadmissible_df &lt;- sample_df |&gt;\n  filter(admissible)\nggplot(admissible_df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  dsan_theme() +\n  # If you were wondering how to make it an actual perfect circle\n  coord_fixed()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd now we can finally use our two necessary conditions, albeit in reverse order:\n\nApplying Necessary Condition 2 (Simplified Version) To This Case:\nTo satisfy this condition, let’s literally just define a pdf \\(f_{X,Y}\\) that has some non-zero value \\(c\\) for points within the circle in the above plot, and has value \\(0\\) otherwise:\n\\[\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\begin{cases}\nc &\\text{if }x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1, \\\\\n0 &\\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nSo far, we’ve satisfied Necessary Condition 1 (\\(NC_1\\)) for \\(f_{X,Y}\\) to be a valid pdf. Now if we can figure out how to also make this function satisfy Necessary Condition 2 (\\(NC_2\\)), we’ll know that we have a valid pdf for \\(Z = (X,Y)\\).\n\n\nApplying Necessary Condition 1 To This Case\nGiven that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are both defined (in a nicely-behaved way) over the range \\([-1,1]\\), the remaining condition \\(NC_1\\) is satisfied if the following equality holds:\n\\[\n\\int_{-1}^{1}\\int_{-1}^{1}f_{X,Y}(x,y)dxdy = 1\n\\tag{1}\\]\nIf you calculate these two definite integrals (you could do it using fancy math, like variable substitution, or just using geometry, e.g. by thinking about what the integral would be given what you know about the areas of circles), you will find that this integral-filled equality reduces to the equality\n\\[\nc\\pi = 1\n\\]\nSo that, finally, we can solve for the value of \\(c\\) which now lets us “fill in this detail”: that if we choose \\(c = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\), so that\n\\[\nf_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{\\pi} &\\text{if }x^2 + y^2 &lt; 1, \\\\\n0 &\\text{otherwise.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nthen we get a nice chain of realizations:\n\nThe equality Equation 1 holds, so\nWe have satisfied \\(NC_1\\), after already satisfying \\(NC_2\\) above, so\nWe have now satisfied both \\(NC_1\\) and \\(NC_2\\),\nThis means we have satisfied \\(B\\), so that finally\nWe have defined a valid pdf \\(f_{X,Y}(x,y)\\) (since \\(B\\) is a sufficient condition for valid pdfs).\n\nI hope that helps somewhat: I wrote things out in excruciating detail, using necessary and sufficient conditions and etc., to try and show how there is a general logic to these types of problems (or at least, a general logic for how we can use the information we’re given to construct a distribution which encodes this information)."

    "text": "Appendix I: Dirac Delta Function\n\n\\(\\delta(v)\\) as used in the “Top Secret Fun Fact” slide is called the Dirac Delta function.\nIt enables conversion of discrete distributions into continuous distributions as it represents an “infinite point mass” at \\(0\\) that can be integrated1:\n\n\\[\n\\delta(v) = \\begin{cases}\\infty & v = 0 \\\\ 0 & v \\neq 0\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nIts integral also has a name: integrating over \\(v \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)\\) produces the Heaviside step function \\(\\theta(v)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\delta(v)dv = \\theta(v) = \\begin{cases} 1 & v = 0 \\\\ 0 & v \\neq 0\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis is leaving out some of the complexities of defining this function so it “works” in this way: for example, we need to use the Lebesgue integral rather than the (standard) Riemann integral for it to be defined at all, and even then it technically fails the conditions necessary for a fully-well-defined Lebesgue integral.

    "text": "Lab 4 Assignment Prep\n\nOne of my favorite math puzzles ever:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Problem of the Broken Stick (Gardner 2001, 273–85)\n\n\n\nIf a stick is broken at random into three pieces, what is the probability that the pieces can be put back together into a triangle?\nThis cannot be answered without additional information about the exact method of breaking\n\nOne method is to select, independently and at random, two points from the points that range uniformly along the stick, then break the stick at these two points\nSuppose, however, that we interpret in a different way the statement “break a stick at random into three pieces”. We break the stick at random, we select randomly one of the two pieces, and we break that piece at random.\n\n\n\n\nWill these two interpretations result in the same probabilities?\nIf yes, what is that probability?\nIf no, what are the probabilities in each case?",

    "text": "Footnotes\n\n\nTextbooks sometimes write \\(F(x) = \\Pr(X \\leq x)\\), where capital \\(X\\) is a RV while lowercase \\(x\\) is a particular value, like \\(3\\). To reduce confusion, I use \\(X\\) for the RV and \\(v\\) for the value at which we’re checking the CDF. Also note capitalized CDF but lowercase pmf/pdf, matching mathematical notation: \\(f_X(v)\\) is the derivative of \\(F_X(v)\\).↩︎\nFun way to avoid memorizing! Imagine a pyramid like \\(\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{\\boxed{\\phantom{1}}}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{\\boxed{\\phantom{1}}}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{\\boxed{\\phantom{1}}}\\), where boxes are slots for numbers. Put a \\(1\\) in box at the top. In bottom row, fill each slot with the sum of the two numbers above-left and above-right of it. Since \\(1 + \\text{(nothing)} = 1\\), this looks like: \\(\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\). Continue filling in rows this way, so next row looks like \\(\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{2}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\), then \\(\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{3}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{2}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{3}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{1}{}\\genfrac{}{}{0pt}{}{}{1}\\), etc. The \\(k\\)th number in the \\(N\\)th row (counting from \\(0\\)) is \\(\\binom{N}{k}\\). Appendix shows triangle written out to 7th row!↩︎\nThis is leaving out some of the complexities of defining this function so it “works” in this way: for example, we need to use the Lebesgue integral rather than the (standard) Riemann integral for it to be defined at all, and even then it technically fails the conditions necessary for a fully-well-defined Lebesgue integral. For full details see this section from the Wiki article on PDFs, and follow the links therein.↩︎",

    "text": "Marginalization In Discrete World\nMarginalization provides an example of where, unlike the case for some topics in the course, having a good intuition for the discrete case will actually help us a ton even when considering the continuous case. So, let’s start out by thinking through a joint discrete distribution, and thinking about what a marginal distribution derived from this joint discrete distribution actually represents.\nConsider a case where we are the principal at a “senior high school” (in the US, this means a high school/secondary school that students attend for grades 10, 11, and 12), where each student is in some grade but also has an honor student status which is 1 if the student is an honor student and 0 otherwise. We can represent the discrete frequency distribution (not that it is not a probability distribution, since the numbers in each “bin” are not between 0 and 1) using the following raw frequency table:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\n\nSo far, we can’t use this table for much of anything, since it doesn’t contain probabilities and we also don’t (yet) know the total number of students, so that we don’t know what proportions of all students fall into each bin.\nSo now let’s say someone asks us the probability that, if we randomly select a student from the school (at uniform), the randomly-selected student will be an honor student in 11th grade.\nBy thinking about what specifically they’re asking for here, we can see that they’re asking us a question about the joint distribution of \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) at the school: specifically, they’re asking us for \\(\\Pr(G = 11, H = 1)\\), a question we can answer if we know the joint distribution \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\).\nUsing our naïve definition of probability, we can compute this probability using the frequencies in the table as\n\\[\n\\Pr(G = 11, H = 1) = \\frac{\\#(G = 11, H = 1)}{\\#\\text{ Students Total}}\n\\]\nand, plugging in the values from the above table, we obtain the answer\n\\[\n\\Pr(G = 11, H = 1) = \\frac{4}{33} \\approx 0.121\n\\]\nFollowing the same logic for all remaining cells in the table, we can convert our frequency table into a probability table by normalizing the counts to be proportions of the total. But, let’s think about two different ways we could compute the total number of students, since we’ll need to think about these two ways later on:\n\nComputing Overall Total by Column (Honors-Status Totals)\nStarting from our original frequency table:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\n\nWe could start computing the total number of students by summing columns, to obtain:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\nTotal\n23\n10\n\n\n\nAnd then we could total these two numbers in the totals row to obtain the overall total:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\n\nTotal\n23\n10\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nComputing Overall Total by Row (Grade)\nAs an alternative to starting our computation of the overall totals by summing columns, we could start by summing rows.\nStarting from our original frequency table:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n\n\n\nWe could first sum each row, to obtain:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n15\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n10\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n8\n\n\n\nAnd then we could total the three partial sums in the totals column to obtain the overall total:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n15\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n10\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n8\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nBringing Both Methods Together\nNotice how we obtained the same overall total, the total number of students, regardless of which dimension we chose to sum over first. So, let’s make a complete frequency table, where we have not only the frequencies of each bin but also the row totals, column totals, and a cell in the bottom-right representing the overall total:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n10\n5\n15\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n6\n4\n10\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n7\n1\n8\n\n\nTotal\n23\n10\n33\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting Frequencies into Probabilities\nNow, before we think about the totals row/column, let’s use the overall total (33) to convert our counts into probabilities:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 0\\)\n\\(H = 1\\)\nTotal\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n\\(\\frac{10}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{5}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{15}{33}\\)\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n\\(\\frac{6}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{10}{33}\\)\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n\\(\\frac{7}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{8}{33}\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(\\frac{23}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{10}{33}\\)\n\\(\\frac{33}{33}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nMore Than One Distribution Can Be Derived From This Table!\nNow that we see the normalized counts, we can see the different ways we can look at this table to obtain probability distributions:\n\nFirst, there’s the distribution we were originally thinking about: the entries in each non-total cell form a probabiltiy distribution called the joint distribution of \\(G\\) and \\(H\\), since each entry is between 0 and 1 and the entries sum to 1:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n&\\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 10, H = 0)}_{10 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 10, H = 1)}_{5 / 33} + \\\\\n&\\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 11, H = 0)}_{6 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 11, H = 1)}_{4 / 33} + \\\\\n&\\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 12, H = 0)}_{7 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 12, H = 1)}_{1 / 33} = 1\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nBut, we can also notice that the two entries in the totals row (excluding the overall total) form a probability distribution, called the marginal distribution of \\(H\\):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\underbrace{\\Pr(H = 0)}_{23 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(H = 1)}_{10 / 33} = 1\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nAnd, the three entries in the totals column (excluding the overall total) form a probability distribution, called the marginal distribution of \\(G\\):\n\n\\[\n\\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 10)}_{15 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 11)}_{10 / 33} + \\underbrace{\\Pr(G = 12)}_{8 / 33} = 1\n\\]\nLet’s consider in a little more detail how we used the joint distribution—the full set of entries in the original table—to derive two different marginal distributions:\nSumming the values in each column:\nWhen we summed up the values in each column, we were summing up all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_H = 0\\) and then all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_H = 1\\). This gave us two new counts (or probabilities, if used the probability table rather than the frequency table) representing the marginal distribution of \\(H\\), a distribution where the variable \\(G\\) no longer appeared!\nSumming the values in each row:\nWhen we instead summed the values in each row, we summed all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_G = 10\\), then all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_G = 11\\), and finally all possible pdf values \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) where \\(v_G = 12\\). This gave us three new counts/probabilities representing the marginal distribution of \\(G\\), a distribution where the variable \\(H\\) no longer appeared!"

    "text": "What’s Missing? Conditional Distributions\nSo far we’ve discussed the interrelationship between joint distributions and marginal distributions: the latter was obtained from the former by summing.\nHowever, there is one type of distribution that is mentioned on your Lab assignment that we haven’t seen yet. The conditional distribution is a bit different from the joint and marginal distributions, in the sense that the conditional distribution does not represent a sum across some dimension of the table but a slice of the table: that is, it represents the new distribution which “pops out” when we consider one particular row or one particular column of the table.\nHowever, just like how above we figured out the marginal distributions by summing over columns and summing over rows separately, and seeing what resulted, let’s explore what conditional distributions look like by slicing the table by column first, then slicing the table by row:\n\nComputing Conditional Distributions as Columns (Honors-Status Values)\nLet’s consider what the table would look like if we just selected a single column: for example, let’s select just the column of values for which \\(H = 1\\). Throwing away all of the other columns in the table, this would give us a one-column table that looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n5\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n4\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n1\n\n\nTotal\n10\n\n\n\nNow notice that, just like how we were able to convert our frequency table into a probability table representing joint probabilities by dividing each of these values by 33 (the overall total of students across all possible grades and honors-status values), now we can convert this slice of the full table into its own distribution by dividing each of these individual values in the \\(H = 1\\) column by the total number of students in the \\(H = 1\\) column:\n\n\n\n\n\\(H = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\\(G = 10\\)\n\\(\\frac{5}{10}\\)\n\n\n\\(G = 11\\)\n\\(\\frac{4}{10}\\)\n\n\n\\(G = 12\\)\n\\(\\frac{1}{10}\\)\n\n\nTotal\n\\(\\frac{10}{10}\\)\n\n\n\nNotice how, unlike in the above two cases, we now have to interpret the numeric value of the probabilities in each cell differently:\n\nJoint and marginal distributions represented some count relative to the total number of students in the school, hence the denominator of all probabilities in either of these cases was 33\nConditional distributions, however, represent a count relative to the number of students within the category we are conditioning on: the denominator is now 10 in each case, since we’re considering the number of students represented by each cell within the column as a proportion of the total number of students across the entire column."

    "text": "Discrete World Summary\nSo, as long as we notice that conditional distributions are weird in the sense that they require us to renormalize all of our probabilities from our table of joint and marginal distributions, we now have the link between all three types of distributions that get talked about when working with multivariate probability distributions:\n\nA single joint distribution: The normalized counts in each cell of the full 2D table; in other words, the probability that a randomly-selected student from across the entire school will be in a particular bin (when students are binned by grade and honors status).\n\nFor example, the bin in the upper-left corner of our original table represents non-honors students in 10th grade (\\(G = 10, H = 0\\)).\n\nTwo marginal distributions: The normalized totals across each row, or across each column, of the full 2D table; in other words, the probability that a randomly-selected student from across the entire school will be in a particular aggregated bin.\n\nIf we aggregated by summing columns, for example, our first aggregated bin represents all non-honors students, students for whom \\(H = 0\\) (regardless of grade), and our second aggregated bin contains all honors students, students for whom \\(H = 1\\) (regardless of grade).\n\nSix possible conditional distributions: The re-normalized counts within a particular column or a particular row; in other words, the probability that a randomly-selected student from a particular category (the category we’re conditioning on) will be in one of the bins represented by individual slots within this row/column.\n\nIf we conditioned on the \\(H = 1\\) column, for example, then once we renormalize the counts in this column, the first entry represents the probability of a randomly-selected honors student being in grade 10: \\(\\Pr(G = 10 \\mid H = 1)\\)\n\n\nNotice, lastly, how we could use this intuition built from frequency tables to figure out how to go in opposite directions from the directions we derived things above: for example, if we were only given marginal distributions and conditional distributions, we could use this information to derive the full-on joint distribution table. Since we know the definition of conditional probability for example, that\n\\[\n\\Pr(B \\mid A) = \\frac{\\Pr(B, A)}{\\Pr(A)},\n\\]\nwe could re-arrange terms in this equality to obtain\n\\[\n\\Pr(B, A) = \\Pr(B \\mid A)\\Pr(A),\n\\]\nfrom which we can see that if we know the conditional distribution \\(\\Pr(B \\mid A)\\) and the marginal distribution \\(\\Pr(A)\\), we can combine these (via multiplication) to obtain the joint distribution \\(\\Pr(B,A)\\)."

    "section": "Moving to Continuous World",
    "text": "Moving to Continuous World\nThe reason I’ve spent so much time focusing on the discrete case here is because the intuitions we just built do indeed translate naturally into good intuitions for reasoning about continuous distributions!\nTaking our discrete table, for example, we can imagine moving into continuous space the same way that we learned how to take discrete rectangles approximating the the space underneath a curve and convert them into integrals: by taking the limit of the area of these rectangles as they got skinnier and skinnier:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above figure, we see how we can imagine summing the area of rectangles approximating the area “under” the curve (really, between the curve and the \\(x\\)-axis), then imagine the rectangles becoming skinnier and skinnier such that the sum of the rectangles’ areas converges to the integral of the function.\nSimilarly, now imagine taking the above table and continuizing our variables: imagine that instead of a student’s progress in school being recorded by a discrete random variable \\(G\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{R}_G = \\{10, 11, 12\\}\\), now we record a student’s progress using a continuous random variable \\(G\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{R}_G = [10,12] \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\).\nBy the same logic, rather than tracking each student’s honor status using a discrete random variable \\(H\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{R}_H = \\{0, 1\\}\\), now we keep track of a student’s honor status using a continuous random variable \\(H\\) such that \\(\\mathcal{R}_H = [0, 1] \\subset \\mathbb{R}\\).\nIn this new continuous world, therefore, we might say that a student near the beginning of 10th grade who is towards the “high end” of the “honors spectrum” might be represented by a pair of values \\(G = 10.03\\) and \\(H = 0.95\\), for example.\nHowever, in this case we can still derive all of the distributions from other distributions in the same way, by:\n\nReplacing the sums we computed above with integrals, and\nReplacing the operation of re-normalization (which we performed to ensure that our probability mass values summed to 1) with the operation of ensuring that our probability density values integrate to 1.\n\nSo, for example, now rather than being given a frequency table, we may just be given the information that students’ \\(G\\) values are distributed according to the continuous uniform distribution, \\(G \\sim \\mathcal{U}(10, 12)\\), that their \\(H\\) values are distributed according to the truncated normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{TN}(\\mu = 0.5, \\sigma = 0.1, a = 0, b = 1)\\)1, and that these two variables are independent, which means that \\(\\Pr(G \\mid H) = \\Pr(G)\\) and \\(\\Pr(H \\mid G) = \\Pr(H)\\) (the conditional distributions are the marginal distributions).\nIn this case, then, we know (by the definition of independence) that we can obtain the joint pdf \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) by just multiplying the pdf of the marginal distribution of \\(G\\), \\(f_G(v_G)\\) and the pdf of the marginal distribution of \\(H\\), \\(f_H(v_H)\\):\n\\[\nf_{G,H}(v_G, v_H) = f_G(v_G) \\cdot f_H(v_H).\n\\]\nSince we know that \\(G\\) has a continuous uniform distribution, \\(G \\sim \\mathcal{U}(10,12)\\), we know (or we could look up) that \\(G\\) has pdf\n\\[\nf_G(v_G) = \\frac{1}{12 - 10} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n\\]\nSince we know that \\(H\\) has a truncated normal distribution, \\(H \\sim \\mathcal{TN}(0.5, 0.1, 0, 1)\\), we know (or we could look up) that \\(H\\) has the pdf\n\\[\nf_H(v_H) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\frac{\\varphi(\\frac{v_H-\\mu}{\\sigma})}{\\Phi(\\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}) - \\Phi(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma})},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\varphi\\) is the pdf of the standard normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) is the CDF of the standard normal distribution \\(\\mathcal{N}(0,1)\\) (note the consistent usage of lowercase letters to describe pdfs and capital letters to describe CDFs, even in Greek!).\nTherefore, given the independence condition, we can obtain the joint pdf \\(f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)\\) by just multiplying these pdfs:\n\\[\nf_{G,H}(v_G, v_H) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma}\\frac{\\varphi(\\frac{v_H-\\mu}{\\sigma})}{\\Phi(\\frac{b-\\mu}{\\sigma}) - \\Phi(\\frac{a - \\mu}{\\sigma})}.\n\\]\nAnd, given this joint pdf, we can integrate wherever we took sums in the discrete case to obtain the marginal pdfs:\n\\[\nf_G(v_G) = \\int_{0}^{1}f_{G,H}(v_G,v_H)dv_H\n\\]\nor\n\\[\nf_H(v_H) = \\int_{10}^{12}f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)dv_G\n\\]\nAnd we can compute conditional pdfs by renormalizing so that the denominator is no longer the integral of the distribution over all its possible values (hence just the number \\(1\\)) but a ratio of joint distribution to marginal distribution values like the following:\n\\[\nf_{H \\mid G}(v_H | v_G) = \\frac{f_{G,H}(v_G, v_H)}{f_G(v_G)}.\n\\]\nSo, while the continuous case does have scarier math than the discrete case, I hope that rather than “lingering” in the continuous world, trying to churn through the meaning of the above equations on their own, you can instead try to link the continuous equations back to their simpler discrete forms given in the previous section, then just convert sums to integrals to complete the picture. That way, you never have to just stare at an integral-filled equation again.\nFor example, given two continuous variables with confusing-looking pdfs or CDFs, start by discretizing (“binning”) the possible values of these continuous values, to obtain a discrete distribution, and build up your intuitions about the relationships between the variables in discrete world.\nIn the previous case, for example, if you were asked to start with the continuous version where \\(G\\) ranges continuously across \\([10,12]\\) and \\(H\\) ranges continuously across \\([0,1]\\), you could start by discretizing these continuous distributions to obtain a table very similar to the table presented at the very beginning of this writeup: if you split the range \\([10,12]\\) into three bins of equal length, and the range \\([0,1]\\) into two bins of equal length, you can start by sampling (say) 1000 \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) values using code, sorting these 1000 samples into these equal-length bins, and reasoning through what the joint/marginal/conditional distributions of this binned distribution look like, before moving back over into continuous world to complete the various portions of the problem…"

    "section": "Approach 2: Using R Like a Fancy Calculator",
    "text": "Approach 2: Using R Like a Fancy Calculator\nIn this approach, we basically just use R (or Python, or whatever else) as a glorified calculator. We take the hard part—reasoning about what the sample space might look like, for example, or whether events are independent—and do it in our heads, then use R to figure out what happens when we multiply/add/divide the things we already figured out.\nContinuing the dice example, for instance, this approach would go something like: we ask you\n\nWhat is the probability that you observe a roll greater than 4, followed by a roll less than or equal to 4, followed by a roll greater than 4?\n\nand you reason through this like,\n\nI already know that there are 6 outcomes, and that they’re all equally likely, so that the probability of seeing a particular outcome in \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\) is always \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\). Therefore I can define an event \\(E_&gt;\\) representing the event of observing an outcome greater than 4, and another event \\(E_\\leq\\) of observing an outcome less than or equal to 4. I know that\n\n\n\nSince the possible outcomes greater than 4 are 5 and 6, my event \\(E_&gt; = \\{5, 6\\}\\), and since \\(\\Omega = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\), I can compute the probability of \\(E_&gt;\\) as \\[\n\\Pr(E_&gt;) = \\frac{|E_&gt;|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{|\\{5, 6\\}|}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nSince the possible outcomes less than or equal to 4 are 1, 2, 3, and 4, my event \\(E_\\leq = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}\\), so I can compute the probability of \\(E_\\leq\\) as \\[\n\\Pr(E_\\leq) = \\frac{|E_\\leq|}{|\\Omega|} = \\frac{|\\{1, 2, 3, 4|}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAnd now I can use R with these probabilities I computed in my head to derive the probabilities of them occurring in a particular sequence:\n\n\n# Encode probabilities of my two events\np_greater &lt;- 1/3\np_less_or_equal &lt;- 2/3\n# Use them to compute the probabilities of sequences\np_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\np_sequence\n\n[1] 0.07407407\n\n\nThis approach may seem boring at first, since again we could have done this just on a calculator, but it becomes interesting when we ask you to vary the numbers to see what happens to the resulting probabilities.\nFor example, if you wrote the above code for some problem, then in the next problem we could say “It turns out the person providing you with the dice was cheating! They rigged it so that there’s actually a 99% chance of getting a number greater than 4! Go back and compute the probability of this sequence but using the rigged die”\nAnd then you could just change the first line of your code, and re-run the whole thing, to obtain the new probability:\n\np_greater &lt;- 0.99\np_less_or_equal &lt;- 0.01\np_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\np_sequence\n\n[1] 0.009801\n\n\nFinally, we might then ask you something like:\n“Your friend actually invented a machine that can generated any rigged die at all, so that the probability of rolling a number greater than 4 is whatever they want it to be.\nYou are worried because you always play a game with this friend where you win if you roll something greater than 4, then less than or equal to 4, then greater than 4. So you want to see how the friend’s rigging machine could affect your likelihood of winning.\nWrite a function that computes your likelihood of winning (i.e., your likelihood of getting this sequence of three rolls), for any die with any probability of producing an outcome greater than 4.\nIn this case, you could now take your code and transform it into a function, like\n\ncompute_win_prob &lt;- function(p_greater) {\n    p_less_or_equal &lt;- 1 - p_greater\n    p_sequence &lt;- p_greater * p_less_or_equal * p_greater\n    return(p_sequence)\n}\n\nAnd then test it on some values:\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.01)\n\n[1] 9.9e-05\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.5)\n\n[1] 0.125\n\ncompute_win_prob(0.99)\n\n[1] 0.009801\n\n\nThen we could ask you to think about\nWhat value for p_greater do you think would maximize your probability of winning?\nand then\nProduce a plot showing your likelihood of winning for 1000 different values of p_greater, evenly spread between 0 and 1\nand you could use the function you wrote like\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\np_greater_vals &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 1000)\n#p_greater_vals\nwin_prob_vals &lt;- sapply(p_greater_vals, compute_win_prob)\nwin_df &lt;- tibble(p_greater=p_greater_vals, win_prob=win_prob_vals)\nggplot(win_df, aes(x=p_greater, y=win_prob)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  dsan_theme(\"full\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Probability of Winning With Rigged Die\",\n    x = \"Pr(Result &gt; 4)\",\n    y = \"Pr(Win)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally, we could ask you to draw a conclusion about this situation:\nLooking at the plot, approximately what value for the rigged die looks like it produces the maximum likelihood of winning? Now write code to compute the actual value, out of the 1000 evenly-spaced values you computed the win probability for, that maximizes your probability of winning. Does it match your guess from earlier?\nFor which you could write code like\n\nmax_prob &lt;- max(win_df$win_prob)\nmax_row &lt;- win_df %&gt;% filter(win_prob == max_prob)\nmax_row\n\n\n\n\n\np_greater\nwin_prob\n\n\n\n\n0.6666667\n0.1481481\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy point in writing all this out is just to say: that was a whole other way to compute probabilities using a computer, where the focus wasn’t on making a big tibble and then extracting smaller chunks out of it and dividing their sizes. We did have to construct a tibble, in order to compute the win probabilities for a spectrum of values, but that was just so we could generate a plot (since ggplot() needed to know specifically what points to put at what coordinates).\nSo, in this approach, we don’t have a single tibble throughout the entire problem that serves as our sample space. We just use tibbles when we need them, as tools for doing math or making plots, while the probabilities themselves are still getting computed using simple multiplication.\nAnd, I mentioned above how the tibble-subsetting method doesn’t allow us to deal with continuous probability distributions. We’ve now seen, on the other hand, how this “fancy calculator” approach is able to deal with such distributions: we were really looking at the distribution of all possible rigged dice, meaning, the space of all dice with \\(\\Pr(\\text{roll greater than 4}) = p\\) for \\(p \\in [0,1]\\). We had to approximate this continuous space using a grid of 1000 samples, which brought us closer to the fancy-spreadsheet approach, but hopefully this can help make it a bit clearer how the fancy-calculator approach can help us when the fancy-spreadsheet approach can’t, even if it (the fancy-calculator approach) requires us to do a lot more math in our heads."

    "text": "Piece 1: Conditional Probability\nLong story short, the main lesson I hope I was able to convey when we first encountered conditional probability is that all probabilities are conditional probabilities!\nIt was our first encounter with a new type of probability distribution, beyond just a “standard” single-variable distribution, so I drew a diagram on the board that looked something like:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe real point of drawing this diagram (for now!) was just to “collapse” what may seem like two different formulas down into one: Expressions for probability distributions like \\(\\Pr(Y = v_Y)\\) are really already expressions for conditional distributions, since we can always rewrite a probabilistic statement about a single event \\(E\\) as a conditional statement:\n\\[\n\\Pr(E) = \\Pr(E \\mid \\Omega) = \\frac{\\Pr(E, \\Omega)}{\\Pr(\\Omega)},\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\Omega\\) is a special “event” that literally just means “anything at all occurs”, so that the denominator of this fraction is exactly \\(1\\) and the numerator is exactly \\(\\Pr(E)\\) (“the probability that something occurs and \\(E\\) occurs”).\nMoving from the case of generic events like \\(E\\) to events involving Random Variables, consider e.g. \\(X = v_X\\), the event that the Random Variable \\(X\\) takes on the particular value \\(v_X\\). Since the “universe” of possible values that \\(X\\) could take on is represented by its support \\(\\mathcal{R}_X\\), we can derive a similar kind of conditional statement from any non-conditional statement about \\(X\\):\n\\[\n\\Pr(X = v_X) = \\Pr(X = v_X \\mid X \\in \\mathcal{R}_X) = \\frac{\\Pr(X = v_X, X \\in \\mathcal{R}_X)}{\\Pr(X \\in \\mathcal{R}_X)},\n\\]\nwhere again the denominator of the fraction is exactly \\(1\\) (“the probability that \\(X\\) takes on one of the possible values that \\(X\\) can take on”), and the numerator is exactly \\(\\Pr(X = v_X)\\). So, when we are working with probabilities involving Random Variables, we are again always working with conditional probabilities. We don’t need to carry around separate non-conditional and conditional formulas for RVs in our heads!\nIn the context of this problem, the takeaway is: if we already know about expectation (see: next section), we may be able to think through and derive a conditional form for it, therefore deriving precisely the “conditional expectation” that this problem is asking for, even if we haven’t encountered the expected value in conditional form before.\nBefore turning to the expected value, though, let’s write out one more atomic-conditional “linkage” here, this time for continuous distributions, where we therefore have to work with probability densities rather than probabilities themselves. As long as we keep in mind the caveat that probability density values are not probabilities themselves (but that they can be integrated to produce probability values), we can define a conditional probability density function for e.g. the random variable \\(Y \\mid X\\) as\n\\[\nf_{Y \\mid X}(y \\mid x) = \\frac{f_{Y,X}(y,x)}{f_X(x)}.\n\\]\nWith this in hand, we can then (repetitively keeping in mind that we need to use integration over regions to generate probability values from probability density functions) see the connection between this conditional density and non-conditional density via our final identity showing how all probability density functions are conditional probability density functions:\n\\[\nf_{Y}(y) = f_{Y \\mid X}(y \\mid \\mathcal{R}_x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f_{Y \\mid X}(y \\mid x)\\mathrm{d}x\n\\]\nWhere we only had to abuse notation a little bit here at the very end by letting \\(\\mathcal{R}_X\\) stand in for the longer “any value at all in \\(X\\)’s support”, i.e., “any value from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\)”."

    "text": "Snapping the Pieces Together\nNow that we’ve looked at each piece individually, let’s think about how we might be able to “fuse” them together into an expression for a conditional expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X]\\).\nFirst, since we’re firmly within continuous world in this Lab, I won’t bore you with the discrete analogue first (though I think it’s helpful to think through!). Instead, let’s look at the definition we have for the expected value \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y]\\):\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}yf_Y(y)\\mathrm{d}y\n\\]\nGiven that \\(\\mathrm{d}y\\) is sort of just… notation that we carry over from calculus2, the two relevant pieces of this expression that we can focus on are \\(y\\) (our variable of integration) and \\(f_Y(y)\\) (the pdf of \\(Y\\) evaluated at the point \\(y\\)).\nSo, since we eventually want \\(\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X]\\)… let’s see what the previous expression could look like if we literally just clunkily “plugged in” \\(Y \\mid X\\) everywhere we see \\(Y\\), and \\(y \\mid x\\) everywhere we see \\(y\\). We’ll call this our “first draft” for a definition of conditional expectation:\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X] = \\int_{\\infty}^{\\infty}(y \\mid x)f_{Y \\mid X}(y \\mid x)\\mathrm{d}(y \\mid x)\n\\]\nIf we stare at this for a bit and try to think through what each piece might mean, my hope is that you can start to get a vague sense of the following two observations:\n\nThe plugging-in was “successful” for \\(f_{Y \\mid X}(y \\mid x)\\), in the sense that this expression is something we do understand and have seen before: it’s the conditional probability that our random variable \\(Y\\) takes on the specific value \\(y\\) within a world where our random variable \\(X\\) has taken on the specific value \\(x\\).\nThe \\((y \\mid x)\\) term, on the other hand, doesn’t seem very well-defined: \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) are non-random values like \\(3\\) or \\(\\pi\\), and here they’re not being plugged into a probability measure like \\(\\Pr(X = x)\\) or a density like \\(f_{Y \\mid X}(y \\mid x)\\).\n\nSo, diving into the second observation: What would \\((y \\mid x)\\) even mean? Semantically, we know that the conditional bar \\(|\\) in the middle means “given”, so that if we read \\((y \\mid x)\\) out it means something like “The value of \\(y\\) given the value of \\(x\\)”. But, to drive the point home: knowing the value of \\(x\\) here is totally irrelevant to the value of \\(y\\), since there’s no randomness or probabilistic uncertainty involved in determining the value of \\(y\\) at all!\nIt’s crucial to distinguish between \\(Y\\) and \\(y\\) here to make sense of this, at least in my brain3. Here \\(y\\) is not a probabilistic Random Variable, it’s an algebraic variable which exists in the expression solely as a “stand-in” for particular values (ranging from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\)) that we’d have to plug in to evaluate the integral.\nI know that way of thinking about it might not click with everyone, but I hope it does click for some! And if it does, then I hope it might have also “clicked” ideas in your head with respect to how we could “handle” the \\((y \\mid x)\\) here:\n\n\\((y \\mid x)\\) represents “the value of \\(y\\) given the value of \\(x\\)”. But…\nThe value of \\(y\\) is not affected by the value of \\(x\\). So…\n\\((y \\mid x)\\) is equivalent to just \\(y\\)!\n\nIf you’ve followed all of the above, then we can apply this conclusion to our “first draft” from above, and simplify it to just\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}yf_{Y \\mid X}(y \\mid x)\\mathrm{d}y\n\\]\nAnd indeed, we did it, we’ve arrived at the definition of conditional expectation, for continuous random variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)!\nIf it helps, we could also rewrite this using our definition of conditional probability density,\n\\[\nf_{Y \\mid X}(y \\mid x) = \\frac{f_{Y,X}(y,x)}{f_X(x)},\n\\]\nto derive the following alternative forms (which are also given in the above Wikipedia article):\n\\[\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}y\\frac{f_{Y,X}(y,x)}{f_X(x)}\\mathrm{d}y = \\frac{1}{f_X(x)}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}yf_{Y,X}(y,x)\\mathrm{d}y.\n\\]"

And, as we know, multiplying a width by a height gives us an area! Therefore, when we sum each of these tiny areas from \\(-\\infty\\) to \\(\\infty\\), we end up with the total area under the curve formed by \\(xf(x)\\).↩︎\nHopefully, if you’ve gotten this far, you can start to understand why I hate the \\(X = x\\) notation, and why I always try to use \\(X = v_X\\) and \\(Y = v_Y\\) instead…↩︎"
